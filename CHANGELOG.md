## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Bump `hjkl-engine` and `hjkl-buffer` workspace pins from `=0.0.25` to
  `=0.0.26`. Pulls in hjkl Phase 5 trait extraction (`spec::*` re-exports,
  optional `ratatui` on `hjkl-engine`, new ratatui-free Editor methods). Buffr
  does not yet depend on `hjkl-editor` and uses no `Rect`-flavoured APIs, so
  this is a transparent pin bump — no source changes required.
